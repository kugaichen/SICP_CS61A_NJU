---the notice for myself or same kind of growing-hackers---

this question worried me a lot of time: there are 2 traps in that question, 
1. the fucntion get_secret return the function itself so that it can be used in 
the next time as the example, samely, it can also return function "protected_secret" 
becaues of its return is just "get_secret".
2. when i thinked of this question, it always puzzled that why the parameter "num_attempts"
was not called, the situation was that i used the same parameter name when i did the judgement
"if num_attempts == 0" and did the parameter updated "num_attempts = num_attempts - 1" and its return 
"protected_secret(password, secret, num_attampts)"
so i think that is parameter names's confusion, which i should avoid it in coding in future.
